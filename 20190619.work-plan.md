client have:
- one route for success response
- second route for error response



## Projects
- tmp-client: working on
- client: ts client, use for redux implementation
- real-world: use monitor implementation from this
- redux edge: oribinal createRequestThunk
- server: current todo server

## 1. finish current work (what is the form problem)
   - form issue fixed
   - added ErrorPane
   - done

## 2. implement redux per 'client'

### Packages added
  - react-redux
  - redux
  - redux-thunk
  - redux-devtools-extension
  - done

## 3. use recommended libraries from redux doc such as cross-fetch, babel polyfill, etc

### Packages added

Per Redux doc
  - babel-polyfill
  - cross-fetch
Put ...
```js
import 'babel-polyfill'
```
... before all other code

## 4. Use async/await for fetch
  - done
## 5. implement monitor per 'real-world'
  - rename /redux to /store
  - add dev || prod store config
  
### Packages added
  - redux-devtools
  - redux-devtools-dock-monitor
  - redux-devtools-log-monitor
  - redux-logger (remove this later)

## 6. reorg client to more standard shape
  - create /ui
  - each ui component in its own folder
  - App calls todosReadRequest

## 6. modify createRequestThunk to take single actions instead of arrays of actions (trial)
