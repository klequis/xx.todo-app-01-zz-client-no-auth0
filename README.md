# todo-app-01-client

A minimal implementation of a React client to call the books API and examine returned error messages.

## What 'book'?

Don't have a final name for it yet but the scratchy beginnings of it are [here](https://github.com/klequis/modern-fullstack-mern/tree/preview).

I'm currently planning to publish it on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) and will open it up for pre-release review once there is enough content to be worth your time.

## Will I finish it?
I keep telling people I am, "Seriously considering writing a book."
- "Seriously", because I have written about 40 pages so far and the sample app that will be built in the book is nearly done.
- "Considering", because it is a big commitment and who really knows if I'll have the time or I'll get pulled into making money and other commitments.
I'll change this to something more certain once I get far enough into it.
